WAIT!!! stop right there,, this is just stupid and simple "hello world" codes.. do not use it if you want to get better at iPhone programming...

All of the programs here is incomplete, because I don't have Development environment to finish it (MAC is super EXPENSIVE!! for me)...

for this time, I'll hide the source tab. If you want to access the code, just contact me.
